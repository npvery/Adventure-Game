###Make a dungeon-based game, and have users move through it. Incorporate traps, health, secret doors, and maybe fighting?
###Direction system should be based on directions, not left and right.


#Direction and movement functions. Keeps track of your position on a 9x9 grid which represents the room, and prevents you from moving
outside the confines of the room (walls).

x_pos = 4
y_pos = 1
def go(direction):
    global x_pos
    global y_pos
    if direction == "North" and y_pos < 9:
        y_pos = y_pos + 1
    elif direction == "East" and x_pos < 9:
        x_pos = x_pos + 1
    elif direction == "South" and y_pos > -9:
        y_pos = y_pos - 1
    elif direction == "West" and x_pos > -9:
        x_pos = x_pos - 1
    elif direction == "North" and y_pos >= 9:

        x = print("Thaaaat is not a direction. You move nowhere.")
        return x
    
#Creating "backpack" for items, populating the map with items which automatically add themselves to the backpack.

#Below doesn't work right now
