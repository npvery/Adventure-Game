###Make a dungeon-based game, and have users move through it. Incorporate traps, health, secret doors, and maybe fighting?
###Direction system should be based on directions, not left and right.


#Direction and movement functions. Keeps track of your position on a 9x9 grid which represents the room, 
#and prevents you from moving outside the confines of the room (walls).

y_pos = 0

#Initialize direction variables as strings for ease of use during gameplay
north = "North"
east = "East"
south = "South"

#Create backpack as list, and initialize variables for items as strings for ease of use during gameplay

#Function to add things to backpack.

#unction to check the square you're on for any items. This automatically adds anything that's there to
#the backpack, and prints the backpack's new contents.
